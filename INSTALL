Building GenomeTools
--------------------

Invoke GNU make, e.g.:

$ make [argument ...]

to build GenomeTools. You need at least version 3.80 of GNU make, you can check
which version you have by invoking

$ make --version

On *BSD GNU make is often called ``gmake''.

Possible arguments:

- 64bit=yes        to compile a 64-bit version (not available on all platforms)
- opt=no           to disable optimization
- assert=no        to disable assertions
- amalgamation=yes to compile as an amalgamation
- cairo=no         to disable AnnotationSketch, dropping Cairo/Pango deps
- errorcheck=no    to disable the handling of compiler warnings as errors
- universal=yes    to build a universal binary

Example call to build GenomeTools without assertions on a system where GNU make
is called ``gmake'':

$ gmake assert=no

Please remember to always run `make cleanup` before rebuilding with changed make
parameters!


Building GenomeTools without the sketch tool:
---------------------------------------------

The AnnotationSketch engine requires the Cairo and Pango headers and libraries
to be installed in order to build GenomeTools. Please consult your operating
system's package manager for more information on how to install these. For
example, on Debian the packages ``libcairo2-dev'' and ``libpango1.0-dev'' must
be installed.
If Cairo and/or Pango headers are not installed on the system, and
AnnotationSketch support is not required, GenomeTools can be built without
graphics support by invoking make as above with the argument cairo=no.


Building GenomeTools with HMMER:
--------------------------------

To enable protein domain search functionality in the ltrdigest tool please also
append the with-hmmer=yes option to the make call. This option will make sure
that a HMMER source package is downloaded and compiled along with the gt binary.
Note that the wget executable must be available in the current PATH to do so
(alternatively, you can download HMMER manually from
ftp://selab.janelia.org/pub/software/hmmer/CURRENT/ and untar it in the
src/external/ subdirectory).

$ make with-hmmer=yes


Building GenomeTools as a Universal Binary (on Mac OS X < v10.6):
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Invoke make as above with the argument universal=yes.
Note that on later Mac OS X systems (those with an Intel CPU) the universal=yes
option is not required. Also, do not use it on Mac OS X 10.6 (Snow Leopard) or
later as PowerPC support has since been discontinued. Thus trying to build a
universal binary may lead to problems.


Building GenomeTools on Windows (using Cygwin):
-----------------------------------------------

Building GenomeTools with gcc on Windows occasionally results a warning
regarding the '-fPIC' parameter. This can be ignored without problems. To ignore
this warning, please append the errorcheck=no option to your make call. All
other options given in this file can still be used.


Testing GenomeTools (optional)
------------------------------

Call

$ make test

to make sure your GenomeTools build went fine. This step requires an installed
Ruby 1.8 interpreter (see http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/ for informations on
Ruby).

Please note that all make options given during the compilation must be given in
the `make test' invocation again. For example, if you compiled GenomeTools with
the '64bit=yes cairo=no' options, the correct installation command would be:

# make 64bit=yes cairo=no test


Installing GenomeTools
----------------------

To install the ``gt'' binary and the ``libgenometools'' library
(plus header files) on your system invoke

$ make install

Per default the files are installed under /usr/local. You can change this with
the prefix argument. For example, to install under /usr, invoke

# make prefix=/usr install

Please note that all make options given during the compilation must be
given in the `make install' invocation again. For example, if you compiled
GenomeTools with the '64bit=yes cairo=no' options, the correct installation
command would be:

# make prefix=/usr 64bit=yes cairo=no install

Omitting these options is likely to lead to problems during installation.

encounter any.
