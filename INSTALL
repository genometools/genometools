Building GenomeTools
--------------------

Invoke GNU make, e.g.:

$ make [argument ...]

to build GenomeTools. You need at least version 3.80 of GNU make, you can check
which version you have by invoking

$ make --version

On *BSD GNU make is often called ``gmake''.

Possible arguments:

- 64bit=yes to compile a 64-bit version (not available on all platforms)
- opt=no to disable optimization
- assert=no to disable assertions
- amalgamation=yes to compile as an amalgamation

Example call to build GenomeTools without assertions on a system where GNU make
is called ``gmake'':

$ gmake assert=no


Building GenomeTools without the curses library:
------------------------------------------------

On systems without an installed curses library invoke make as above with the
argument curses=no

If you invoked make without curses=no beforehand, do not forget to run `make
clean` before running `make curses=no`.


Building GenomeTools without the sketch tool (if Cairo is not installed):
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

invoke make as above with the argument cairo=no


Building GenomeTools with HMMER:
--------------------------------

To enable protein domain search functionality in the ltrdigest tool please also
append the with-hmmer=yes option to the make call. This option will make sure
that a HMMER source package is downloaded and compiled along with the gt binary.
Note that the wget executable must be available in the current PATH to do so
(alternatively, you can download HMMER 2.3.2 manually from
ftp://selab.janelia.org/pub/software/hmmer/CURRENT/ and untar it in the src/external/
subdirectory).

$ make with-hmmer=yes


Building GenomeTools as a Universal Binary (on Mac OS X):
--------------------------------------------------------

invoke make as above with the argument universal=yes


Building GenomeTools on Windows (using Cygwin):
--------------------------------------------------------

Building GenomeTools with gcc on Windows occasionally results a warning
regarding the '-fPIC' parameter. This can be ignored without problems.
To ignore this warning, please append the errorcheck=no option to your
make call. All other options given in this file can still be used.


Testing GenomeTools (optional)
------------------------------

Call

$ make test

to make sure your GenomeTools build went fine.
This step requires an installed Ruby interpreter (see
http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/ for informations on Ruby).


Installing GenomeTools
----------------------

To install the ``gt'' binary and the ``libgenometools'' library
(plus header files) on your system invoke

$ make install

Per default the files are installed under /usr/local
You can change this with the prefix argument. For example, to install under
/usr invoke

# make prefix=/usr install


Final note
-----------

Please look at http://genometools.org for updates and report bugs if you
encounter any.

Enjoy!
