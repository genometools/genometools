- fix self-referential parent (e.g., GFF3 entry with ID=gene1;Parent=gene1)


feature requests:
-----------------

- replace sscanf calls
- consensus_sa: fuzzlength, undetermined strand
- add more coverage tests
- use tool from tridge to find functions which are are not used
- write check script to check for error_check()
- EXIT_SUCCESS und EXIT_FAILURE only in gtr.c and gt.c
- no exit() calls inside library
- update design.html, describe interface inheritance
- check for circles
- write proper memory allocator
- function similary to option_new_choice(), but which allows to set multiple
  strings from the given set
- make sure that exons and mRNAs of a gene lie in the range defined by the gene
- compute the phase correctly (in cds_visitor?)
- establish naming conventions and use them throughout entire codebase
- implement simpler solution for multiset_matching
- implement cleanup stack exeception handling
- compute correlation coefficient and average in `gt eval`
- try to write dynalloc() as static inline function (without always setting the
  return pointer)


merge libgtcore and libgtmatch:
-------------------------------

- replace FastaReader with SeqIterator
- Encodedseq und Bioseq mergen ()
- merge Timer und measure-time.c (Ereignis, formatierter String)
