1.7.8 Thu Nov  2 12:52:18 AMT 2006
dvd: build script for OpenVMS by Jim Duff, http://eight-cubed.com/

1.7.7 Sun Jan 29 11:13:23 PST 2006
dvd: rnv exits with non-zero return code if validation fails.

1.7.6 Fri Jan  7 01:07:37 AMT 2005
dvd: base64: I hope I got it right this time.

Thu Jan  6 15:46:55 AMT 2005
dvd: base64 regular expression checks full syntax of RFC2045.

1.7.5 Thu Jan  6 02:18:51 AMT 2005
dvd: build error fixed

1.7.4 Wed Jan  5 13:55:41 AMT 2005
dvd: unit tests for s.c and xsd.c. 

1.7.3 Wed Jan  5 05:57:55 AMT 2005
dvd: bug in xsd.c:b64cmpn fixed (thanks to Sridhar Guthula), 
     tiny code cleanup in comparison routines. 

1.7.2 Tue Nov  9 15:28:23 AMT 2004
dvd: fixed a bug in rvp.py, didn't update the current pattern after
     text or mixed

1.7.1 Thu Aug 19 00:58:58 AMST 2004
dvd: discovered and fixed a bug with parsing of builtin datatypes,
     noone seems to use them explicitely.

1.7.0 Sat Mar 27 19:26:39 AMT 2004
dvd: entities are not expanded, use XX if you need to.
     error messages have the same syntax as Jing's.

1.6.6 Sun Mar 21 22:41:10 AMT 2004
dvd: turned on parsing of external parameter entities;
     with the next next release rnv will be split in two;
     the core utility will just validate an XML stream, an optional
     preprocessor will handle entities, dtds and xinclude

1.6.5 Sat Mar 13 21:24:31 AMT 2004
dvd: continued overhaul of rn.c and other places

1.6.4 Fri Mar 12 13:15:33 AMT 2004
dvd: looked again at the code in rn.c and rnl.c, streamlined and simplified
     many things

Fri Mar 12 04:44:17 AMT 2004
dvd: better logics in mark_p

1.6.3 Thu Mar 11 22:47:17 AMT 2004
dvd: Bug fix in mark_p -- no more dangling references to unused patterns.

1.6.2 Mon Mar  8 13:22:52 AMT 2004
dvd: Added processing of davidashen-net-xg-file and -pos PIs to
     work with xg.

1.6.1 Mon Mar  1 12:55:48 AMT 2004
dvd: Added ranlib to Makefile to make rnv build smoothly on Mac OS X.

1.6.0 Thu Feb 26 21:14:39 AMT 2004
dvd: fixed mixed to be interleave, not choice. The test for this
     was wrong.

Wed Feb 25 03:59:45 AMT 2004
dvd: got rid of ##; prone to name conflicts

1.5.8 Wed Feb 18 16:53:05 AMT 2004
dvd: enhanced diagnostics: first required elements and attributes
     are reported, then optional

1.5.7 Mon Feb 16 20:03:13 AMT 2004
dvd: rewrote the pattern space compression algorithm -- it should
     be correct now, and if it is still not, debugging should be
     much easier

1.5.6 Tue Feb 10 19:37:07 AMT 2004
dvd: actually turned path checks on

1.5.5 Fri Jan 30 11:07:01 AMT 2004
dvd: added check for recursion in structured regexps

1.5.4 Fri Jan 30 00:10:32 AMT 2004
dvd: implemented structured regexps for scheme-datatypes

1.5.3 Thu Jan 29 03:19:29 AMT 2004
dvd: made it compile on SunOS 5.8 (name clashes)

1.5.2 Wed Jan 28 15:35:38 AMT 2004
dvd: added handler for external system entities
     Makefile.bcc is back; people still need win32, and cygwin is bulky.

Wed Jan 28 01:43:42 AMT 2004
dvd: removed static pointers from rnv and qualified name passed
     from Expat is modified instead. This is safe.

Mon Jan 26 21:13:30 AMT 2004
dvd: ++ moved out of assert in xsd_tm.c

1.5.1 Mon Jan 26 01:25:42 AMT 2004
dvd: Internal release, regexp in Scheme implemented

Sat Jan 24 22:42:58 AMT 2004
dvd: fixed rx.c: upper bound in quantifier

Fri Jan 23 21:51:34 AMT 2004
dvd: newRef+1 is initialized to 0 (bugfix, integrity check in ht)

Wed Jan 21 02:38:09 AMT 2004
dvd: SCM is now working as embedded engine; it was not obvious
     that the initialization call had to be lower on the stack
     than all other calls to SCM;
     static mode added to m, if M_STATIC is non-zero it is the
     size of available memory in bytes -- good for debugging.
     
Tue Jan 20 22:24:50 AMT 2004
dvd: changed rx to conform to XSD errata (- is not a valid range)
     added -d and -e to rnv; I was not sure for a long time whether
     I should do it.

Tue Jan 20 04:45:39 AMT 2004
dvd: rearranged a lot of things; put error reporting through a single
     function er_vprintf, useful for interfacing to scripting languages;
     some success with dsl -- dsl-equal? works

Tue Jan 20 00:24:56 AMT 2004
dvd: renamed strops to s, memops to m, functions has s_ and m_ prefixes

Mon Jan 19 13:43:57 AMT 2004
dvd: fixed typo in diagnostics when literal is missing after ~

Thu Jan 15 18:10:02 AMT 2004
dvd: added -d command to rvp to load external type checker;
     dxl.c dxl.h implement
     http://davidashen.net/relaxng/pluggable-datatypes datatype;
     xsdck makes xsd: pluggable.

1.4.1 Tue Jan 13 14:29:08 AMT 2004
dvd: added sys/types.h where appropriate; fixed Makefile.bcc
     to include rnl.{c,h,obj}

1.4.0 Mon Jan 12 17:39:58 AMT 2004
dvd: changed rvp.py to use os.read|os.write for performance

Mon Jan 12 03:53:56 AMT 2004
dvd: rvp is implemented; reads validation events from input, sends diagnostics
     to output; embedding examples in perl and python

Sat Jan 10 03:18:12 AMT 2004
dvd: factored out loading of rnc into rnl; now, instead of calling rnc
     and rnd separately, rnl_(fn|fd|s) is called.

1.3.5 Tue Jan  6 11:56:06 AMT 2004
dvd: learned that UTF-8 BOM is reality, added processing; fixed check for name
     characters in arx, made it >0x7f||nmtoken  (no good reason to process unicode);
     added end-of-line to error messages from Expat

1.3.4 Mon Jan  5 22:43:05 AMT 2004
dvd: grammar samples added to the distribution, entries for other grammars
     commented out in tools/arx.conf

Mon Jan  5 17:00:57 AMT 2004
dvd: isany is now ary_isany (ary is helpers for arx)

Mon Jan  5 00:56:25 AMT 2004
dvd: rnx_isany is added. It is used by arx and checks for a pattern that matches any element;
     should be written as
	      any = (element * {any}|attribute * {text}|text)*
     (triple choice, elements in any order)

Sun Jan  4 03:38:10 AMT 2004
dvd: Renamings

1.3.3 Sat Jan  3 18:58:36 AMT 2004
dvd: arx, a grammar (and not just grammar) association utility has been added;
     performance improvements, Makefile.bcc to compile the binaries under
     win32+Borland C/C++ builder

1.3.2 Fri Jan  2 04:30:30 AMT 2004
dvd: multiple cleanups and speedups; ht_deli added

Tue Dec 30 23:40:59 AMT 2003
dvd: uri2rnc.pl and rnv.vim as a proof-of-concept; learned a lot of things
     about vim

Tue Dec 30 17:24:05 AMT 2003
dvd: added warning about include in includeContent

Tue Dec 30 04:19:22 AMT 2003
dvd: expected now correctly returns attributes behind elements

Mon Dec 29 20:26:01 AMT 2003
dvd: error handling refactored, validation logic separated from command-line interface

1.3.1 Mon Dec 29 01:58:38 AMT 2003
dvd: invalid elements are correctly skipped (they were supposed to before), but the code
     contained a fallout that prevented them from doing so

1.3.0 Mon Dec 29 01:57:46 AMT 2003
dvd: pattern pools are now one-dimensional, pointer arithmetics is a little more
     complex, but performance and memory use are better; besides, this makes pattern
     datatype extensible, which is a good thing

1.2.1 Fri Dec 26 15:50:49 AMT 2003
dvd: error reporting redone; errors for xsd and rx are routed through validation
     errors' handler

Fri Dec 26 01:55:37 AMT 2003
dvd: debugged on NIST tests; the only tests which don't pass when they should
     are those with doubles due to overflow and underflow.

Thu Dec 25 19:30:55 AMT 2003
dvd: added puorg_nr to implement attribute_open correctly;
     empty elements are correctly validated against data and values;
     equality and ordering for dateTime (and its partial variants) implemented;
     rx,xsd use overloadable error handlers with variable lists.

1.2.0 Wed Dec 24 04:40:25 AMT 2003
dvd: XML Schema Part 2: regular expressions and datatypes. many things are
     implemented, with exception of context-dependent checks and a calendar
     library; optimizations and cleanups.

Fri Dec 19 22:19:05 AMT 2003
dvd: rn_params joined with rn_string

1.1.0 Fri Dec 19 03:56:46 AMT 2003
dvd: drv_attribute_open|drv_attribute_close and memoization implemented;
     hash values are multiplied by large primes - helps with current hashing
     algorithms; garbage collection added to rn (rn_compress,
     rn_compress_last); compact mode implemented for validation, the buffer for
     memoized patterns does not exceed a limit when the validator runs in
     compact mode.

1.0.9 Wed Dec 17 23:36:05 AMT 2003
dvd: drv_mixed_text added, results memoized; code cleanups to compile easier;
     added targets for static and shared libraries to the Makefile, many small
     touch-ups

1.0.8; Tue Dec 16 14:05:16 AMT 2003
dvd: memory for error message in rnv.c is allocated properly

1.0.7; Tue Dec 16 00:12:04 AMT 2003
dvd: added reporting of attribute value for invalid attributes
