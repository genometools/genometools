/* Implements the <GtGenomeNode> interface. A single feature node corresponds
   to a GFF3 feature line (i.e., a line which does not start with <#>).
   Part-of relationships (which are realized in GFF3 with the <Parent> and <ID>
   attributes) are realized in the C API with the
   <gt_feature_node_add_child()> method.

   Besides the ``mere'' feature nodes two ``special'' feature nodes exist:
   multi-features and pseudo-features.

   Multi-features represent features which span multiple lines (it is indicated
   in GFF3 files by the fact, that each line has the same ID attribute).

   To check if a feature is a multi-feature use the method
   <gt_feature_node_is_multi()>.
   Multi-features are connected via a ``representative''. That is, two features
   are part of the same multi-feature if they have the same representative.
   The feature node representative can be be retrieved via the
   <gt_feature_node_get_multi_representative()> method.

   Pseudo-features became a technical necessity to be able to pass related
   top-level features as a single entity through the streaming machinery.
   There are two cases in which a pseudo-feature has to be introduced.

   First, if a multi-feature has no parent. In this case all features which
   comprise the multi-feature become the children of a pseudo-feature.

   Second, if two or more top-level features have the same children (and are
   thereby connected). In this case all these top-level features become the
   children of a pseudo-feature.

   It should be clear from the explanation above that pseudo-features make only
   sense as top-level features (a fact which is enforced in the code).

   Pseudo-features are typically ignored during a traversal to give the illusion
   that they do not exist. */
