/* The <GtReads2Twobit> class is a specialized encoder for large collections of
   sequencing reads in FastQ and Fasta format. After encoding, the information
   is accessible as a GtTwobitencoding representation in memory and can be
   output to disk in a GtEncseq-compatible format.
   It is designed to be fast and memory efficient, and thus has some
   limitations compared to the encoding feature of GtEncseq: the only supported
   input is Fasta/FastQ with a DNA alphabet; reads containing wildchars are
   removed; the descriptions are discarded; the md5 are not calculated.
   Paired-end libraries are supported. The input may consists in sets of two
   files (forward reads and reverse reads, in the same order) or a single file
   with interleaved reads. In paired-end mode, if a sequence is discarded (e.g.
   because it contains ambiguities), then its mate is discarded too.
   Both equal lenght and variable length sequence collections are supported.
   Reads2Twobit automatically switches to variable length mode when the first
   sequence is encoded, whose length is not the same of the previous
   sequences. */
