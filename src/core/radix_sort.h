/* This file describes the interface of a radixsort implementation
   which allows for keys of type <GtUword>, optionally associated
   with values of type <GtUword>. Thus the implementation can
   sort arrays referenced by pointers of type <GtUword *>,
   or arrays referenced by pointers of type <GtUlongPair *>.
<<<<<<< HEAD
   In the latter case, the component <a> is the key and <b> is the
   value.

   The implementation of radixsort allows one to split the array
   to be sorted into a given number of at least two parts, which
   are sorted independently. Let <n> be the length of the array and
   <p> be the number of parts.
   - When running radix sort with <p> threads, each part is sorted by
     its own thread, requiring an array of size <n> as auxiliary space.
     In the ideal case, the speedup for sorting all parts is <1/p>.
   - When running radixsort with one thread, the parts are sorted
     one after the other, requiring an array of size <n/p> as
     auxiliary space.

   The time and space improvements cannot be combined.

   The disadvantage of the splitting method is the fact, that,
   in order to obtain a completely sorted array, the different
   parts have to be merged. As the methods to merge the
   arrays in-place require extra space and thus would sacrifice the
   space advantage, we have not added appropriate code and suppose that
   the results of the final sorting are immediately processed anyway.
   Thus we only need a mechanism to simultaneously read the <p> sorted parts.
   This mechanism is implemented by the class GtRadixreader which, for
   efficiency reasons, is not opaque and mainly accessed via macros. */
