\section{Introduction} \label{Introduction}

\Readjoiner is a software pipeline for the \textit{de novo} assembly of
 sequencing readsets, based on the assembly string graph framework
  \cite{MYE:2005}.

\Readjoiner is written in \texttt{C} and it is based on the
\GenomeTools library \cite{genometools}. It has no external library
dependencies and may be compiled on any POSIX-compliant operative system.
 \Readjoiner is implemented as a collection of tools, all compiled in the single
\GenomeTools binary named \Gtcmd.

\subsection{Variable and fixed-length readsets}

Several next generation technologies, such
as the Illumina Genome Analyzers, are synchronous and thus produce
readsets, where the read length is constant: in \Readjoiner these
are called \textit{eqlen} readsets.
Eqlen reads are fully supported by \Readjoiner.

Other technologies, such as Roche 454, produce
reads with different read lengths (in \Readjoiner called \textit{varlen}
readsets). \Readjoiner currently provides only an experimental support for varlen reads.

\subsection{Pipeline overview}

The \Readjoiner assembly pipeline consists in three phases, summarized in the
 following table.

\begin{tabular}{lll}
Phase & Tool & Description \\
\textit{Prefiltering} & \Rdjprefiltercmd &
  encode reads, remove contained and ambiguous\\
\textit{Overlap}   & \Rdjoverlapcmd &
  determine all pairs suffix-prefix matches (SPMs) \\
\textit{Assembly}  & \Rdjassemblycmd &
 build the string graph, output the contigs \\
\end{tabular}

In the next sections more information about each of the phases is provided.

\subsection{Step 1: Prefiltering}

The first step in the \Readjoiner pipeline is the \Rdjprefilter tool.
The input to \Rdjprefilter shall be a set of sequencing reads in
one or more MultiFASTA file\footnote{
  }.
Input formats different from FASTA can be converted using GenomeTools,
as explained in Section \ref{nonfastainput}.

Contained reads represent redundant sequence information, which is not included
in the string graph \cite{MYE:2005}. Two categories of contained
reads can be distinguished: reads which are suffices or prefices of other reads or reverse complements
of reads (including duplicated reads) and internally contained reads, which
are equal to an internal substring of other reads or reverse complements of reads.

Reads which are suffixes or prefixes of other reads can be efficiently
identified by sorting all reads
and their reverse complements. This is done by \Rdjprefilter.
Additionally \Rdjprefilter removes any read which include ambiguity codes,
as these cannot be unambiguosly assembled with other reads.

The output of the \Rdjprefilter tool is a sequence in
\GenomeTools encoded sequence format.

\subsection{Step 2: Overlap phase}

To construct the string graph, the suffix-prefix matches (SPM) among all pairs
of reads must be calculated. Due to the small size of the DNA alphabet (4),
small random matches from reads originating from different regions of the
original DNA molecule are common. Thus, to avoid spurious matches a minimal
match length pameter $\minlen$ is used.

Transitive edges are not present in the final string graph \cite{MYE:2005}.
 \Rdjoverlap matching algorithm allows one to recognize which SPM would
 correspond to transitive edges in the graph. Thus the graph can be constructed
 only including the irreducible edges, requiring less memory.

The \Rdjoverlap tool computes the list of suffix-prefix matches among
all pairs of reads using a suffix sorting and scanning approach.
Non-relevant suffixes are excluded, such as those shorter
than $\minlen$ or without an initial $k$-mer matching a read or reverse
complement of read.

An index of the SPM-relevant suffixes is constructed during this phase.
The index construction is partitioned in order to limit the
space peak.
\Readjoiner uses heuristics
to automatically calculates a value for this parameter, which is usually
a good choice..
However, a memory limit or number of parts can be given as a parameter
to control this time vs.\ space tradeoff.

\subsection{Step 3: Assembly phase}

The \Rdjassembly tool constructs a string graph. Each non-contained read
in the sequencing readset is represented by a pair of vertices modeling
its two extremities (Begin and End vertices). Irreducible SPMs are represented
by directed edges.

Sequencing errors present in the reads lead to characteristic paths
in the graph. The error-correction algorithms described in \cite{Edena}
are experimentally implemented and can be applied to recognize dead ends
and p-bubbles and remove them. Finally the graph is traversed and sequences
corresponding to unbranched paths are output.

\section{Usage} \label{Usage}

In the following text:

\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{Typewriter font} is used for the names of software tools.
\item \texttt{\small{Small typewriter font}} is used for file names.
\item \begin{footnotesize}\texttt{Footnote sized typewriter font}
      \end{footnotesize} with a leading
      \begin{footnotesize}\texttt{'-'}\end{footnotesize}
      is used for program options.
\item \Showoptionarg{small italic font} is used for the argument(s) of an
      option.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Command-line tools} \label{Overview}

\Readjoiner is a collection of tools (a toolbox) which are part of
the \Gtcmd binary. Tools are called on the command line as follows:

\texttt{gt} \texttt{readjoiner} \texttt{<toolname>} $[$\Showoption{option}
 \Showoptionarg{arguments(s)}$]+$

where toolname is prefilter, overlap or assembly.

An overview of the most common options of a given tool is output, when the
option \Showoption{help} is used.
\footnote{Additional options may be also available, which
 may be displayed using the options \Showoption{help+} and
  \Showoption{helpdev}. These may be
 in some cases test, experimental or untested parts of the software.}.

\subsection{The \Rdjprefilter tool}

Input: reads (single or multiple uncompressed files) in FASTA format.

\texttt{gt} \texttt{contfilter} $[$\Showoption{option}
 \Showoptionarg{arguments(s)}$]+$

\begin{Justshowoptions}
\Option{db}{\Showoptionarg{inputfilename}}{
Specify the name of the MultiFASTA files to be used as input.}
\Option{readset}{\Showoptionarg{readsetname}}{
(optional) Specify a name to be used by \Readjoiner for the readset.\\
Default: first input filename.}
\Option{v}{}{
Be verbose.}
\Option{q}{}{
Suppress standard output messages.}
\end{Justshowoptions}

Output: the output consists in a readset
in \GenomeTools encoded sequence format, containing all reads except the ones which
are prefixes
or suffixes of other reads or reverse complements of other reads and the reads
containing ambuiguity codes.

\subsection{The \Rdjoverlap tool}

Input: a prefix- and suffix-free readset in \GenomeTools encoded sequence format
(such as the output of \Rdjprefilter).

\begin{Justshowoptions}
\Option{readset}{\Showoptionarg{readset}}{
Specify the readset name.}
\Option{l}{\Showoptionarg{minlen}}{
Specify the minimal SPM length parameter.}
\Option{v}{}{
Be verbose.}
\Option{q}{}{
Suppress standard output messages.}
\end{Justshowoptions}

Output: the output consists in a \texttt{.spm} file, containing a binary encoded
list\footnote{To convert the list to a text format, use the following command:
\texttt{gt readjoiner spmtest -readset <readsetname> -test showlist}.}
 of the non-redundant irreducible suffix-prefix matches in the readset.

\subsection{The \Rdjassembly tool}

Input: a SPM list in \Readjoiner format
(such as the output of \Rdjoverlap).

\begin{Justshowoptions}
\Option{readset}{\Showoptionarg{readset}}{
Specify the readset name}
\Option{l}{\Showoptionarg{minlen}}{
(optional) Specify the minimal SPM length parameter.
The value should be at least as high as the one used for \Rdjoverlap.
If an higher value is used, shorter overlaps are not loaded in the
string graph.}
\Option{errors}{}{
Clean short dead ends and remove p-bubbles}
\Option{v}{}{
Be verbose.}
\Option{q}{}{
Suppress standard output messages.}
\end{Justshowoptions}

\section{Examples}

Consider a dataset containing fixed-length reads (e.g.\ Illumina reads)
in the files \texttt{ilreads1.fas} and \texttt{ilreads2.fas}.

The first step will be run by \Rdjprefilter.

\begin{footnotesize}
\begin{verbatim}
> gt readjoiner prefilter -readset myreadset -db ilreads1.fas ilreads2.fas ilreads3.fas
\end{verbatim}
\end{footnotesize}

The result is output in
\GenomeTools encoded sequence format and consist in a \texttt{readset.esq} file.
The encoded sequence can now be used as input for \Rdjoverlap. We will use
a minimal SPM lenght of 45 for this example.

\begin{footnotesize}
\begin{verbatim}
> gt readjoiner overlap -readset readset -l 45
\end{verbatim}
\end{footnotesize}

The output will be a file \texttt{readset.spm}, containing
a list of irreducible non-redundant SPMs in \Readjoiner binary format.

The next step consists in running the assembly phase using the
\Rdjassembly tool.

\begin{footnotesize}
\begin{verbatim}
> gt readjoiner assembly -readset readset -l 45
\end{verbatim}
\end{footnotesize}

The contigs are saved in FASTA format in \texttt{readset.contigs.fas}.
Basic statistics of the assembly results, such as the N50 value
and the total length, are displayed in the standard output.

\section{Experimental features}

\subsection{Variable-length readsets}

The processing of a variable-length readset is identical to the one described
in the previous section.

\subsection{Real world datasets}

Reads containing sequencing errors, such as the case of real world datasets,
should first be handled using a sequencing error correction tool.
Then, the prefilter and overlap tools shall be run as explained.
In the assembly phase, the \Showoption{errors} option shall be used.

\section{Appendix}

\subsection{Input format conversion}
\label{nonfastainput}

Sequencing readsets in format different from FASTA must be converted before
entering the \Readjoiner pipeline.

\GenomeTools provide some convertion tools.
FASTA with qualities (FASTQ) can be converted into FASTA using the \Gtreadreads
tool. Other common sequence formats can be converted using \Gtconvertseq.
