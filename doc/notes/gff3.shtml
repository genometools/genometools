<h3>Generic Feature Format Version 3 (GFF3)</h3>

<br />
<h4>Summary</h4>

<p>
Author:  Lincoln Stein<br />
Date:    26 February 2013<br />
Version: 1.21<br />
</p>

<p>
Although there are many richer ways of representing genomic features
via XML and in relational database schemas, the stubborn persistence
of a variety of ad-hoc tab-delimited flat file formats declares the
bioinformatics community's need for a simple format that can be
modified with a text editor and processed with shell tools like grep.
The GFF format, although widely used, has fragmented into multiple
incompatible dialects.  When asked why they have modified the
published Sanger specification, bioinformaticists frequently answer
that the format was insufficient for their needs, and they needed to
extend it.  The proposed GFF3 format addresses the most common
extensions to GFF, while preserving backward compatibility with
previous formats. The new format:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>Adds a mechanism for representing more than one level of
    hierarchical grouping of features and subfeatures.</li>

    <li>Separates the ideas of group membership and feature
    name/id.</li>

    <li>Constrains the feature type field to be taken from a
    controlled vocabulary.</li>

    <li>Allows a single feature, such as an exon, to belong to more
    than one group at a time.</li>

    <li>Provides an explicit convention for pairwise alignments.</li>

    <li>Provides an explicit convention for features that occupy
    disjunct regions.</li>

</ol>

<br />
<h4>Online Validator</h4>

<p>
An online GFF3 validator is available at <a
href="http://modencode.oicr.on.ca/cgi-bin/validate_gff3_online">http://modencode.oicr.on.ca/cgi-bin/validate_gff3_online</a>
It is limited to files of three million lines or less. If you wish to
validate larger files, please use the command-line version which can
be downloaded from the same site.
</p>

<br />
<h4>Description of the Format</h4>

<p>
GFF3 files are nine-column, tab-delimited, plain text files. Literal
use of tab, newline, carriage return, the percent (%) sign, and
control characters must be encoded
using <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986#section-2.1">RFC
3986 Percent-Encoding</a>; no other characters may be
encoded. Backslash and other ad-hoc escaping conventions that have
been added to the GFF format are not allowed.  The file contents may
include any character in the set supported by the operating
environment, although for portability with other systems, use of
Latin-1 or Unicode are recommended.
</p>

<ul>
    <li>tab (%09)
    <li>newline (%0A)
    <li>carriage return (%0D)
    <li>%  percent (%25)
    <li>control characters (%00 through %1F, %7F)
</ul>

<p>
In addition, the following characters have reserved meanings in column
9 and must be escaped when used in other contexts:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>;  semicolon (%3B)
    <li>=  equals (%3D)
    <li>&amp;  ampersand (%26)
    <li>,  comma (%2C)
</ul>

<p>
Note that unescaped spaces are allowed within fields, meaning that
parsers must split on tabs, not spaces.  Use of the "+" (plus)
character to encode spaces is depracated from early versions of the
spec and is no longer allowed.
</p>

<p>
Undefined fields are replaced with the "." character, as described in
the original GFF spec.
</p>

<dl>
<dt>Column 1: "seqid"</dt>

<dd>
The ID of the landmark used to establish the coordinate system for the
current feature. IDs may contain any characters, but must escape any
characters not in the set [a-zA-Z0-9.:^*$@!+_?-|].  In particular, IDs
may not contain unescaped whitespace and must not begin with an
unescaped "&gt;".
</dd>

<dt>Column 2: "source"</dt>

<dd>
The source is a free text qualifier intended to describe the algorithm
or operating procedure that generated this feature.  Typically this is
the name of a piece of software, such as "Genescan" or a database
name, such as "Genbank."  In effect, the source is used to extend the
feature ontology by adding a qualifier to the type creating a new
composite type that is a subclass of the type in the type column.
</dd>

</dl>

<dt>Column 3: "type"</dt>

<dd>
The type of the feature (previously called the "method").  This is constrained
to be either: (a)a term from the "lite" version of the Sequence Ontology -
SOFA, a term from the full Sequence Ontology - it must be an is_a child of
sequence_feature (SO:0000110) or (c) a SOFA or SO accession number.  The
latter alternative is distinguished using the syntax SO:000000.
</dd>

<dt>Columns 4 &amp; 5: "start" and "end"</dt>

<dd>
<p>
The start and end coordinates of the feature are given in positive
1-based integer coordinates, relative to the landmark given in column
one.  Start is always less than or equal to end.  For features that
cross the origin of a circular feature (e.g. most bacterial
genomes, plasmids, and some viral genomes), the requirement for
start to be less than or equal to end is satisfied by making end =
the position of the end + the length of the landmark feature.
</p>

<p>
For zero-length features, such as insertion sites, start equals end
and the implied site is to the right of the indicated base in the
direction of the landmark.
</p>
</dd>

<dt>Column 6: "score"</dt>

<dd>
The score of the feature, a floating point number.  As in earlier
versions of the format, the semantics of the score are ill-defined.
It is strongly recommended that E-values be used for sequence
similarity features, and that P-values be used for ab initio gene
prediction features.
</dd>

<dt>Column 7: "strand"</dt>

<dd>
The strand of the feature.  + for positive strand (relative to the
landmark), - for minus strand, and . for features that are not
stranded.  In addition, ? can be used for features whose strandedness
is relevant, but unknown.
</dd>

<dt>Column 8: "phase"</dt>

<dd>
<p>
For features of type "CDS", the phase indicates where the feature
begins with reference to the reading frame.  The phase is one of the
integers 0, 1, or 2, indicating the number of bases that should be
removed from the beginning of this feature to reach the first base of
the next codon. In other words, a phase of "0" indicates that the next
codon begins at the first base of the region described by the current
line, a phase of "1" indicates that the next codon begins at the
second base of this region, and a phase of "2" indicates that the
codon begins at the third base of this region. This is NOT to be
confused with the frame, which is simply start modulo 3.
</p>

<p>
For forward strand features, phase is counted from the start
field. For reverse strand features, phase is counted from the end
field.
</p>

<p>
The phase is REQUIRED for all CDS features.
</p>
</dd>

<dt>Column 9: "attributes"</dt>

<dd>

<p>
A list of feature attributes in the format tag=value.  Multiple
tag=value pairs are separated by semicolons.  URL escaping rules are
used for tags or values containing the following characters: ",=;".
Spaces are allowed in this field, but tabs must be replaced with the
%09 URL escape.  Attribute values do not need to be and should not be
quoted.  The quotes should be included as part of the value by parsers
and not stripped.
</p>

<p>
These tags have predefined meanings:
</p>

<dl>

<dt>ID</dt>

<dd>
Indicates the ID of the feature.  IDs for each feature must be unique
within the scope of the GFF file.  In the case of discontinuous
features (i.e. a single feature that exists over multiple genomic
locations) the same ID may appear on multiple lines.  All lines that
share an ID collectively represent a single feature.  <dd>

<dt>Name</dt>

<dd>
Display name for the feature.  This is the name to be displayed to the
user.  Unlike IDs, there is no requirement that the Name be unique
within the file.  <dd>

<dt>Alias</dt>

<dd>
A secondary name for the feature.  It is suggested that this tag be
used whenever a secondary identifier for the feature is needed, such
as locus names and accession numbers.  Unlike ID, there is no
requirement that Alias be unique within the file.  <dd>

<dt>Parent</dt>

<dd>
Indicates the parent of the feature.  A parent ID can be used to group
exons into transcripts, transcripts into genes, an so forth.  A
feature may have multiple parents.  Parent can *only* be used to
indicate a partof relationship.  <dd>

<dt>Target</dt>

<dd>
Indicates the target of a nucleotide-to-nucleotide or
protein-to-nucleotide alignment.  The format of the value is
"target_id start end [strand]", where strand is optional and may be
"+" or "-".  If the target_id contains spaces, they must be escaped as
hex escape %20.  <dd>

<dt>Gap</dt>

<dd>
The alignment of the feature to the target if the two are not
collinear (e.g. contain gaps).  The alignment format is taken from the
CIGAR format described in
the <a href="http://cvs.sanger.ac.uk/cgi-bin/viewvc.cgi/exonerate/?root=ensembl">Exonerate
documentation</a>.  See "THE GAP ATTRIBUTE" for a description of this
format.
<dd>

<dt>Derives_from</dt>

<dd>
Used to disambiguate the relationship between one feature and another
when the relationship is a temporal one rather than a purely
structural "part of" one.  This is needed for polycistronic genes.
See "PATHOLOGICAL CASES" for further discussion.  <dd>

<dt>Note</dt>

<dd>
   A free text note.
<dd>

<dt>Dbxref</dt>

<dd>
A database cross reference.  See the section
"Ontology Associations and Db Cross References" for
details on the format.
<dd>

<dt>Ontology_term</dt>

<dd>
A cross reference to an ontology term.  See the section "Ontology
Associations and Db Cross References" for details.  <dd>

<dt>Is_circular</dt>

<dd>
A flag to indicate whether a feature is circular.  See extended discussion below.
<dd>

</dl>

<p>
Multiple attributes of the same type are indicated by separating the
values with the comma "," character, as in:
<p>

<div class="code">Parent=AF2312,AB2812,abc-3</div>

<p>
In addition to Parent, the Alias, Note, Dbxref and Ontology_term
attributes can have multiple values.
</p>

<p>
Note that attribute names are case sensitive.  "Parent" is not the
same as "parent".
</p>

<p>
All attributes that begin with an uppercase letter are reserved for
later use.  Attributes that begin with a lowercase letter can be used
freely by applications.
</p>

</dd>
</dl>

<h4>The Canonical Gene</h4>

<img src="img/figure1.png" alt="Figure1" style="padding: 5px; border: 1px solid" />
<p>FIGURE 1</p>

<br />

<p>
This section describes the representation of a protein-coding gene in
GFF3. To illustrate how a canonical gene is represented, consider
Figure 1 (figure1.png).  This indicates a gene named EDEN
extending from position 1000 to position 9000.  It encodes three
alternatively-spliced transcripts named EDEN.1, EDEN.2 and EDEN.3, the
last of which has two alternative translational start sites leading to
the generation of two protein coding sequences.
</p>

<p>
There is also an identified transcriptional factor binding site
located 50 bp upstream from the transcriptional start site of EDEN.1
and EDEN2.
</p>

<p>
Here is how this gene should be described using GFF3:

<p>
Lines beginning with '##' are directives (sometimes called pragmas or
meta-data) and provide meta-information about the document as a whole.
Blank lines should be ignored by parsers and lines beginning with a
single '#' are used for human-readable comments and can be ignored by
parsers.  End-of-line comments (comments preceeded by # at the end of
and on the same line as a feature or directive line) are not allowed.
</p>

<p>
Line 0 gives the GFF version using the ##gff-version pragma. Line 1
indicates the boundaries of the region being annotated (a 1,497,228 bp
region named "ctg123") using the ##sequence-region pragma.
</p>

<p>
Line 2 defines the boundaries of the gene.  Column 9 of this line
assigns the gene an ID of gene00001, and a human-readable name of
EDEN.  Because the gene is not part of a larger feature, it has no
Parent.
</p>

<p>
Line 3 annotates the transcriptional factor binding site.  Since it is
logically part of the gene, its Parent attribute is gene00001.
</p>

<p>
Lines 4-6 define this gene's three spliced transcripts, one line for
the full extent of each of the mRNAs. These features are necessary to
act as parents for the four CDSs which derive from them, as well as
the structural parents of the five exons in the alternative splicing
set.
</p>

<p>
Lines 7-11 identify the five exons. The Parent attributes indicate
which mRNAs the exons belong to.  Notice that several of the exons
share the same parents, using the comma symbol to indicate multiple
parentage.
</p>

<p>
Lines 12-24 denote this gene's four CDSs. Each CDS belongs to one of
the mRNAs.  cds00003 and cds00004, which correspond to alternative
start codons, belong to the same mRNA.
</p>

<p>
Note that several of the features, including the gene, its mRNAs and
the CDSs, all have Name attributes.  This attributes assigns those
features a public name, but is not mandatory.  The ID attributes are
only mandatory for those features that have children (the gene and
mRNAs), or for those that span multiple lines.  The IDs do not have
meaning outside the file in which they reside.  Hence, a slightly
simplified version of this file would look like this:

these features, you may either (1) create a placeholder mRNA and use
it as the parent for the exon and CDS subfeatures; or (2) attach the
exons and CDSs directly to the gene.  This is allowed by SO because of

<h4>Circular Genomes</h4>

<p>

For a circular genome, the landmark feature should include
Is_circular=true in column 9.  In the example below, from
bacteriophage f1, gene II extends across the origin from positions
6477-831.  The feature end is given as length of the landmark feature,
J02448, plus the distance from the origin to the end of gene II (6407
+ 831 = 7238).

<br />
<h4>Representing Spliced Non-Coding Transcripts</h4>

<p>
For spliced non-coding transcripts, such as those produced by some
processed snRNAs and viruses, use a parent feature of
"noncoding_transcript" and a child of "exon."
</p>


<br />
<h4>Parent (part_of) Relationships</h4>

<p>
The reserved Parent attribute can be used to establish a part-of
relationship between two features.  A feature that has the Parent
attribute set is interpreted as asserting that it is a part of the
specified Parent feature.
</p>

<p>
Features must respect the Sequence Ontology Part-Of relationships.  A
Parent relationship between two features that is not one of the
Part-Of relationships listed in SO should trigger a parse exception
Similarly, a set of Parent relationships that would cause a cycle
should also trigger an exception.
</p>

<p>
The GFF3 format does not enforce a rule in which features must be
wholly contained within the location of their parents, since some
elements of the Sequence Ontology (e.g. enhancers in genes) allow for
distant cis relationships.
</p>


<br />
<h4>The Gap Attribute</h4>

<p>
Protein and nucleotide alignment features typically consist of two
sequences, the reference sequence and the "target", and are not always
colinear.  For example, consider the following alignment between an
EST ("EST23") and a segment of the genome ("chr3"):
</p>

<div class="code">
chr3  (reference)  1 CAAGACCTAAACTGGAT-TCCAAT  23
EST23 (target)     1 CAAGACCT---CTGGATATCCAAT  21
</div>

<p>
Previous versions of the GFF format would represent this alignment as
three colinear segments, but this made it difficult to reconstruct the
gapped alignment.  GFF3 recommends representing gapped alignments
explicitly with the "Gap" attribute.  The Gap attribute's format
consists of a series of (operation,length) pairs separated by space
characters, for example "M8 D3 M6".  Each operation is a single-letter
code:
</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Code</td>
    <th>Operation</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>M</td>
    <td>match</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I</td>
    <td>insert a gap into the reference sequence</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>D</td>
    <td>insert a gap into the target (delete from reference)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>F</td>
    <td>frameshift forward in the reference sequence</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>R</td>
    <td>frameshift reverse in the reference sequence</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>
In the alignment between EST23 and chr3 shown above, chr3 is the
reference sequence referred to in the first column of the GFF3 file,
and EST23 is the sequence referred to by the Target attribute.  This
gives a Gap string of "M8 D3 M6 I1 M6". The full GFF match line will
read:
</p>

<div class="code">
chr3 . Match 1 23 . . . ID=Match1;Target=EST23 1 21;Gap=M8 D3 M6 I1 M6
</div>

<p>
For protein to nucleotide matches, the M, I and D operations apply to
amino acid residues in the target and nucleotide base pairs in the
reference in a 1:3 residue.  That is, "M2" means to match two amino
residues in the target to six base pairs in the reference.  Hence this
alignment:
</p>

<div class="code">
100 atgaaggag---gttattgcgaatgtcggcggt
  1 M..K..E..V..V..I..-..N..V..G..G..
</div>

<p>
Corresponds to this GFF3 Line:
</p>

<div class="code">
ctg123 . nucleotide_to_protein 100 129 . + . ID=match008;Target=p101 1 10;Gap=M3 I1 M2 D1 M4
</div>

<p>
In addition, the Gap attribute provides &lt;F&gt;orward and &lt;R&gt;everse
frameshift operators to allow for frameshifts in the alignment.  These
are in nucleotide coordinates: a forward frameshift skips forward the
indicated number of base pairs, while a reverse frameshift moves
backwards.  Examples:
</p>

<div class="code">
100 atgaaggag---gttattgaatgtcggcggt     Gap=M3 I1 M2 F1 M4
  1 M..K..E..V..V..I...
			N..V..G..G


100 atgaaggag---gttataatgtcggcggt        Gap=M3 I1 M2 R1 M4
  1 M..K..E..V..V..I.
		      N..V..G..G
</div>

<br />
<h4>Alignments</h4>

<p>
In the SO, an alignment between the reference sequence and another
sequence is called a "match".  In addition to the generic "match"
type, there are the subclasses:
  <ul>
    <li>cDNA_match</li>
    <li>EST_match</li>
    <li>translated_nucleotide_match</li>
    <li>nucleotide_to_protein_match</li>
    <li>nucleotide_motif</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>
Matches typically contain gaps; matches broken up by large gaps are
usually called "HSPs" (high-scoring segment pair), and previous
incarnations of GFF have handled gapped alignments by breaking up the
alignment into a series of ungapped HSPs.
</p>

<p>
The SO does not have an HSP type.  Instead, gapped matches are
represented as a single feature that occupies a discontinuous location
on the reference sequence.  Figure 2 shows the same gene as before,
but with a new track added showing an alignment of a sequenced cDNA to
the genome.  For the purposes of illustration, we have shown the
regions of alignment to be exact across the three exons of the second
spliced transcript (EDEN.2).
</p>

<img src="img/figure2.png" alt="Figure2" style="padding: 5px; border: 1px solid" />
<p>FIGURE 2</p>

<p>
The recommended way to represent this alignment is with a single
feature of type "cDNA_match" and a Gap attribute that indicates that
the alignment is in three segments:
</p>

<div class="code">
ctg123 . cDNA_match 1050  9000  6.2e-45  +  .    ID=match00001;Target=cdna0123 12 2964;Gap=M451 D3499 M501 D1499 M2001
</div>

<p>
Parsed out, the Target attribute indicates that the sequence named
"cdna0123" between bases 12 and 2964 (in cdna coordinates) aligns to
bases 1050 to 9000 of ctg123.  The Gap attribute is easier to
read when spaces are inserted:
</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>M451</td>
    <td>match 451 bases</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>D3499</td>
    <td>skip 3499 bases in the reference ctg123 sequence</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>M501</td>
    <td>match the next 501 bases</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>D1499</td>
    <td>skip 1499 bases in the reference ctg123</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>M2001</td>
    <td>match the next 2001 bases</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>
Note that the matched region is 2953 bases, which corresponds exactly
to the matching subsequence [12,2964] of the target.  Extra bases in
the cDNA which would cause gaps in the reference sequence would be
indicated using the CIGAR "I" notation.
</p>

<p>
Another important item to note is that the ID corresponds to the Match
and not to the target sequence.  This avoids the confusion that has
occurred in previous incarnations of GFF which made it impossible to
distinguish between a particular alignment of a target sequence to the
genome and all alignments of a target sequence to the genome.
</p>

<p>
A limitation of the Gap representation is that the entire alignment
shares the same score (column 6).  To give each component of the match
a separate score, it can be broken across multiple lines as shown
here:
</p>

<div class="code">
ctg123 . cDNA_match 1050  1500  5.8e-42  +  . ID=match00001;Target=cdna0123 12 462
ctg123 . cDNA_match 5000  5500  8.1e-43  +  . ID=match00001;Target=cdna0123 463 963
ctg123 . cDNA_match 7000  9000  1.4e-40  +  . ID=match00001;Target=cdna0123 964 2964
</div>

<p>
Notice that the ID is the same across each of the three lines,
indicating that these lines all refer to a single feature, the Match.
Each aligning segment, however has a distinct score and Target region.
</p>

<p>
The two types of representations can be mixed, allowing large aligned
segments to have their own GFF line and score, while small gaps within
them are represented using a Gap attribute.
</p>

<p>
Matches can align to either the + or the - strand of the reference
sequence.  This should be denoted in the seventh column of the GFF
line and *not* by changing the order of the start and end positions in
the Target attribute.  To illustrate this, Figure 3 adds an EST pair
to the annotation.  The two ESTs, mjm1123.5 and mum1123.3 correspond
to 5' and 3' EST reads from the same cDNA clone.  The following GFF3
lines describe them:
</p>


<div class="code">
ctg123 . EST_match 1200  3200  2.2e-30  +  .    ID=match00002;Target=mjm1123.5 5 506;Gap=M301 D1499 M201
ctg123 . EST_match 7000  9000  7.4e-32  -  .     ID=match00003;Target=mjm1123.3 1 502;Gap=M101 D1499 M401 
</div>

<p>
Please note that the subsequence indicated by the Target always uses
the coordinate system of the EST, regardless of the direction of the
alignment.  For the 3' EST, the seventh column contains a "-" to
indicate that the match is to the reverse complement of ctg123.  The
Gap attribute does not change as a consequence of this reverse
complementation, and is read from left to right in the usual manner.
</p>

<p>
An application may wish to group the EST pair into a single feature.
This can be accomplished by creating an implied cDNA_match that
extends from the left end of the first EST to the right end of the
last EST, and indicating that this cDNA match is the Parent of the two
ESTs. The parts of the match use the SO "match_part" term. A
match_part can be used as a subpart of any type of match.
</p>

<div class="code">
ctg123 . cDNA_match 1200  9000  .        .  . ID=cDNA00001
ctg123 . match_part  1200  3200  2.2e-30  +  .     ID=match00002;Parent=cDNA00001;Target=mjm1123.5 5 506;Gap=M301 D1499 M201

<h4>Transcript-Relative Alignments</h4>

<p>
The representation of strandedness in nucleotide-to-nucleotide and
protein-to-nucleotide alignments is a common source of confusion in
GFF files.  This section will attempt to explain it.
</p>

<h5>Case #1: alignment to a + strand transcript</h5>

<p>
Consider a pair of EST matches to the genome:
</p>

<div class="code">
 =============================  genome
     -------------------&gt;       transcript
     ------&gt;        &lt;----
      EST_A (5')    EST_B (3')
</div>

<p>
EST_A is a 5' EST and its sequence (as represented in a FASTA file,
for example) is in the same strand as the genomic sequence.  It is
represented as:
</p>

<div class="code">
ctg123 . EST_match  1000 1500 . + . ID=match001;Target=EST_A 1 500 +
</div>

<p>
The strand field in column #7 is "+" indicating that the match is to
the forward strand of the genome.  The optional strand field in the
Target attribute is also +, indicating that the alignment is to the
plus strand of the implied underlying transcript.
</p>

<p>
Let us now consider EST_B , which is a 3' EST. Its sequence as
represented in the FASTA file aligns to the reverse complement of the
genomic sequence.  It is represented as:
</p>

<div class="code">
ctg123 . EST_match  2000 2500 . + . ID=match002;Target=EST_B 1 500 -
</div>

<p>
The strand field in column #7 is "+" indicating that the match is to a
transcript feature on the forward of the genome.  The strand field in
the Target attribute is -, indicating that the EST sequence should be
reverse complemented in order to align to the underlying transcript.
</p>

<h5>Case #2: alignment to a - strand transcript</h5>

<p>
Here is the opposite case:
</p>

<div class="code">
 =============================  genome
     &lt;--------------------      transcript
      ------&gt;        &lt;----
      EST_D (3')  EST_C (5')
</div>

<p>
In this case, the 5' EST_C aligns to the reverse complement of the
forward strand of the genome, while the 3' EST_D aligns to the forward
strand directly.  These are represented as follows:
</p>

<div class="code">
ctg123 . EST_match  2000 2500 . - . ID=match001;Target=EST_C 1 500 +
ctg123 . EST_match  1000 1500 . - . ID=match001;Target=EST_D 1 500 -
</div>

<p>
The first line indicates that the transcript is on the - strand of the
genome, and that EST_C aligns to the transcripts forward strand.  The
second line uses - in the 7th column to indicate that the transcript
is on the minus strand, and - in the Target field to indicate that
EST_D aligns to the minus strand of the transcript.
</p>

<p>
<em>Confused?</em>  Just remember that for purposes of display, the source
and target strands will be multipled together.  A +/+ or -/-
alignment indicates that the reference sequence and the target
sequence can be aligned directly.  A +/- or -/+ alignment indicates
that the target must be reverse complemented in order to align to
the plus strand of the reference sequence.
</p>

<p>
A similar rule applies to TBLASTX alignments, which rely on matching
the six-frame translation of the source to the six-frame translation
of the target.  Consider the case of two genomes that align together
in the forward direction, whose alignment is supported by translations
of genes A and B, one of which is on the plus strand, and the other on
the minus strand:
</p>

<div class="code">
  =============================&gt;  genome X
       ------&gt;        &lt;----
       gene A          gene B
  =============================&gt;  genome Y
</div>

<p>
These two alignments will be  represented as:
</p>

<div class="code">
X TBLASTX translated_nucleotide_match 1000 1500 . + . ID=matchA;Target=Y 500 1000 +
X TBLASTX translated_nucleotide_match 2000 2500 . - . ID=matchB;Target=Y 1500 2000 -
</div>

<p>
Note that the first alignment is +/+ and the second is -/-.  Both
indicate that the sequences of genomes X and Y can be aligned
directly.
</p>

<p>
Now we look at the case of two genomes that align in the antiparallel
direction:
</p>

<div class="code">
=============================&gt;  genome X
     ------&gt;        &lt;----
     gene A          gene B
&lt;=============================  genome Y
</div>

<p>
These two alignments will be represented as:
</p>

<div class="code">
X TBLASTX translated_nucleotide_match 1000 1500 . + . ID=matchA;Target=Y 500 1000 -
X TBLASTX translated_nucleotide_match 2000 2500 . - . ID=matchB;Target=Y 1500 2000 +
</div>

<p>
The first match indicates that a plus strand feature of genome X
aligns to a minus strand feature of genome Y.  The second match
indicates that a minus strand feature of genome X aligns to a plus
strand feature of genome Y.  In both cases, the result is to align the
plus strand of genome X to the minus strand of genome Y.
</p>

<h4>Ontology Associations and DB Cross References</h4>

<p>
Two reserved attributes, Ontology_term and Dbxref, can be used to
establish links between a GFF3 feature and a data record contained in
another database.  Ontology_term is reserved for associations to
ontologies, such as the Gene Ontology.  Dbxref is used for all other
cross references.  While there is no firm boundary line between these
two concepts, curators tend to treat ontology associations differently
and hence ontology terms have been given their own reserved attribute
label.
</p>

<p>
The value of both Ontology_term and Dbxref is the ID of the cross
referenced object in the form "DBTAG:ID".  The DBTAG indicates which
database the referenced object can be found in, and ID indicates the
identifier of the object within that database.  IDs can contain
unescaped colons but DBTAGs cannot, so parsing code should split on
the first colon encountered in the attribute value.
</p>

<p>
The format of each type of ID varies from database to database.  An
authoritative list of databases, their DBTAGs, and the URL
transformation rules that can be used to fetch the objects given their
IDs can be found at this location: <a
href="ftp://ftp.geneontology.org/pub/go/doc/GO.xrf_abbs">ftp://ftp.geneontology.org/pub/go/doc/GO.xrf_abbs</a>

</p>

<p>
Here are some common examples:
</p>

<dl>
<dt>a dbxref to an EMBL sequence accession number:</dt>
<dd>Dbxref="EMBL:AA816246"</dd>
<dt>a dbxref to an NCBI gi number:</dt>
<dd>Dbxref="NCBI_gi:10727410"</dd>
<dt>a Ontology_term referring to a GO association</dt>
<dd>Ontology_term="GO:0046703"</dd>
</dl>

<br />
<h4>Other Syntax</h4>

<p>
Comment lines begin with the '#' symbol.  End-of-line comments
(comments preceeded by '#' at the end of and on the same line as a
feature or directive line) are not allowed.  Directive lines
(sometimes refered to as pragmas or meta-data) are preceded by '##'.
Application specific directives are allowed, but are not required to
be supported by parsers.  The following directives are specified:
</p>

<dl>
  <dt>##gff-version 3.2.1</dt>

  <dd>
  The GFF version follows the format of 3.#.# in this spec.  This
  directive must be present, must be the topmost line of the file.
  The version number always begins with 3, the second and third
  numbers are optional and indicate a major revision and a minor
  revision respectively.
  </dd>

  <dt>##sequence-region seqid start end</dt>
  <dd>
  The sequence segment referred to by this file, in the format "seqid
  start end".  This element is optional, but strongly encouraged
  because it allows parsers to perform bounds checking on
  features. There may be multiple ##sequence-region directives, each
  corresponding to one of the reference sequences referred to in the
  body of the file, however only one ##sequence-region directive may
  be given for any given seqid.  While a ##sequence-region pragma is
  not required for any or all landmark features when one is given all
  features on that landmark feature (having that seqid) must be
  contained within the range defined by that ##sequence-region
  diretive.  An exception to this rule is allowed when a landmark
  feature is marked with the Is_circular attribute.  In that case the
  features contained on that landmark may extend their coordiantes
  beyond the boundary as described above.
  </dd>

  <dt>##feature-ontology URI</dt>
  <dd>
  This directive indicates that the GFF3 file uses the ontology
  of feature types located at the indicated URI or URL.
  Multiple URIs may be added, in which case they are
  merged (or raise an exception if they cannot be merged).  The
  URIs for the released sequence ontologies are:
  <ul>

  The repository for SOFA releases is here: <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/song/files/SO_Feature_Annotation/">http://sourceforge.net/projects/song/files/SO_Feature_Annotation/</a>
  </p>

  <p> 
  This directive may occur several times per file.  If no
  feature ontology is specified, then the most recent release of the
  Sequence Ontology is assumed.
  </p>
 
  <p>
  If multiple directives are given and a feature type is matched
  by multiple ontologies, the matching ontology included by the
  directive highest in the file wins the reference.  The Sequence
  Ontology itself is always referenced last.
  </p>

  <p>
  The content referenced by URI must be in OBO or DAG-Edit
  format.
  </p>
  </dd>

  <dt>##attribute-ontology URI</dt>
  <dd>
  This directive indicates that the GFF3 uses the ontology of
  attribute names located at the indicated URI or URL.  This
  directive may appear multiple times to load multiple URIs, in
  which case they are merged (or raise an exception if merging
  is not possible).  Currently no formal attribute ontologies
  exist, so this attribute is for future extension.
  </dd>

  <dt>##source-ontology URI</dt>
  <dd>
  This directive indicates that the GFF3 uses the ontology of
  source names located at the indicated URI or URL.  This
  directive may appear multiple times to load multiple URIs, in
  which case they are merged (or raise an exception if merging
  is not possible).  Currently no formal source ontologies
  exist, so this attribute is for future extension.
  </dd>

  <dt>##species NCBI_Taxonomy_URI</dt>
  <dd>
  This directive indicates the species that the annotations
  apply to. The preferred format is a NCBI URL that points to
  the relevant species page in either of the following formats:
  <ul>
    <li><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Taxonomy/Browser/wwwtax.cgi?id=6239">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Taxonomy/Browser/wwwtax.cgi?id=6239</a></li>

  </ul>
  </dd>

  <dt>##genome-build source buildName</dt>
  <dd>
	The genome assembly build name used for the coordinates given
	in the file. Please specify the source of the assembly as well
	as its name. Examples (the parentheses are comments).

<div class="code">
##genome-build NCBI B36           (human)
##genome-build WormBase ws110     (worm)
##genome-build FlyBase  r4.1      (drosophila)
</div>
  </dd>

  <dt>###</dt>
  <dd>
  This directive (three # signs in a row) indicates that all
  forward references to feature IDs that have been seen to this
  point have been resolved.  After seeing this directive, a
  program that is processing the file serially can close off any
  open objects that it has created and return them, thereby
  allowing iterative access to the file.  Otherwise, software
  cannot know that a feature has been fully populated by its
  subfeatures until the end of the file has been reached.  It
  is recommended that complex features, such as the canonical
  gene, be terminated with the ### notation.
  </dd>

  <dt>##FASTA</dt>
  <dd>

  <p>
  This notation indicates that the annotation portion of the file is
  at an end and that the remainder of the file contains one or more
  sequences (nucleotide or protein) in FASTA format.  This allows
  features and sequences to be bundled together.  All FASTA sequences
  included in the file must be included together at the end of the
  file and may not be interspersed with the features lines.  Once a
  ##FASTA section is encountered no other content beyond valid FASTA
  sequence is allowed.
  </p>

<h4>Pathological Cases</h4>

<p>The following section discusses how to represent "pathological" cases
that arise in prokaryotic and eukaryotic genetics. Most of these have
to do with organisms' endlessly creative ways of processing
transcripts.
</p>

<dl>
  <dt>Single exon genes</dt>
  <dd>
  <p>
  This is the case in which a single unspliced transcript encodes a
  single CDS.
  </p>

<div class="code">
-----&gt;XXXXXXX*------&gt;
</div>

  <p>
  The preferred representation is to create a gene, a
  transcript, an exon and a CDS:
  </p>

<div class="code">
chrX  . gene XXXX YYYY  .  +  . ID=gene01;name=resA
chrX  . mRNA XXXX YYYY  .  +  . ID=tran01;Parent=gene01
chrX  . exon XXXX YYYY  .  +  . Parent=tran01
chrX  . CDS  XXXX YYYY  .  +  . Parent=tran01
</div>

  </p>
  Some groups will find this redundant. A valid alternative is to omit
  the exon feature:
  </p>

<div>
chrX  . gene XXXX YYYY  .  +  . ID=gene01;name=resA
chrX  . mRNA XXXX YYYY  .  +  . ID=tran01;Parent=gene01
chrX  . CDS  XXXX YYYY  .  +  . Parent=tran01
</div>

  <p>
  It is not recommended to parent the CDS directly onto the gene,
  because this will make it impossible to determine the UTRs (since the
  gene may validly include untranscribed regulatory regions).
  </p>

  <p>
  Also note that mixing the two styles, as in the case of an organism
  with both spliced and unspliced transcripts, is liable to lead to
  the confusion of people working with the GFF3 file.
  </p>

  <dt>Polycistronic transcripts<dt>
  <dd>
  <p>
  This is the case in which a single (possibly spliced) transcript
  encodes multiple open reading frames that generate independent protein
  products.
  </p>

<div class="code">
-----&gt;XXXXXXX*--&gt;BBBBBB*---&gt;ZZZZ*--&gt;AAAAAA*-----
</div>

  <p>
  Since the single transcript corresponds to multiple genes that can be
  identified by genetic analysis, the recommended solution here is to
  create four "gene" objects and make them the parent for a single
  transcript. The transcript will contain a single exon (in the
  unspliced case) and four separate CDSs:
  </p>

<div class="code">
chrX  . gene XXXX YYYY  .  +  . ID=gene01;name=resA
chrX  . gene XXXX YYYY  .  +  . ID=gene02;name=resB
chrX  . gene XXXX YYYY  .  +  . ID=gene03;name=resX
chrX  . gene XXXX YYYY  .  +  . ID=gene04;name=resZ
chrX  . mRNA XXXX YYYY  .  +  . ID=tran01;Parent=gene01,gene02,gene03,gene04
chrX  . exon XXXX YYYY  .  +  . ID=exon00001;Parent=tran01
chrX  . CDS  XXXX YYYY  .  +  . Parent=tran01;Derives_from=gene01
chrX  . CDS  XXXX YYYY  .  +  . Parent=tran01;Derives_from=gene02
chrX  . CDS  XXXX YYYY  .  +  . Parent=tran01;Derives_from=gene03
chrX  . CDS  XXXX YYYY  .  +  . Parent=tran01;Derives_from=gene04
</div>

  <p>
  To disambiguate the relationship between which genes encode which
  CDSs, you may use the Derives_from relationship.
  </p>
  </dd>

  <dt>Gene containing an intein</dt>

  <dd>
  <p>
  An intein occurs when a portion of the protein is spliced out and the
  two polypeptide fragments are rejoined to become a functional
  protein. The portion that is spliced out is called the "intein," and
  it may itself have intrinsic molecular activity:
  </p>

<div class="code">
-----&gt;XXXXXXyyyyyyyyyyXXXXXXX*-------

(yyyyyy is the intein)
</div>

  <p>
  The preferred representation is to create one gene, one transcript,
  one exon, and one CDS. The CDS produces a pre-polypeptide using the
  "Derives_from" tag, and this polypeptide in turn gives rise to two
  mature_polypeptides, one each for the intein and the flanking protein:
  </p>

<div class="code">
chrX  . gene               XXXX YYYY  .  +  . ID=gene01;name=resA
chrX  . mRNA               XXXX YYYY  .  +  . ID=tran01;Parent=gene01
chrX  . exon               XXXX YYYY  .  +  . Parent=tran01
chrX  . CDS                XXXX YYYY  .  +  . ID=cds01;Parent=tran01
chrX  . polypeptide        XXXX YYYY  .  +  . ID=poly01;Derives_from=cds01
chrX  . mature_polypeptide XXXX YYYY  .  +  . ID=poly02;Parent=poly01
chrX  . mature_polypeptide XXXX YYYY  .  +  . ID=poly02;Parent=poly01
chrX  . intein             XXXX YYYY  .  +  . ID=poly03;Parent=poly01
</div>

  <p>
  Because the flanking mature_polypeptide has discontinuous coordinates
  on the genome, it appears twice with the same ID.
  </p>

  <p>
  If the intein is immediately degraded, you may not wish to annotate it
  explicitly, and its line would be deleted from the example.  However,
  if it has molecular activity, it may correspond to a gene, in which
  case:
  </p>

<div class="code">
chrX  . gene               XXXX YYYY  .  +  . ID=gene01;name=resA
chrX  . gene               XXXX YYYY  .  +  . ID=gene02;name=inteinA
chrX  . mRNA               XXXX YYYY  .  +  . ID=tran01;Parent=gene01,gene02
chrX  . exon               XXXX YYYY  .  +  . Parent=tran01
chrX  . CDS                XXXX YYYY  .  +  . ID=cds01;Parent=tran01
chrX  . polypeptide        XXXX YYYY  .  +  . ID=poly01;Derives_from=cds01
chrX  . mature_polypeptide XXXX YYYY  .  +  . ID=poly02;Parent=poly01;Derives_from=gene01
chrX  . mature_polypeptide XXXX YYYY  .  +  . ID=poly02;Parent=poly01;Derives_from=gene01
chrX  . intein             XXXX YYYY  .  +  . ID=poly03;Parent=poly01;Derives_from=gene02
</div>

  <p>
  The term "polypeptide" is part of SO.  The terms "mature_polypeptide"
  and "intein" are slated to be added in a pending release.
  </p>
  </dd>

  <dt>Trans-spliced transcript</dt>
  <dd>
  <p>
  This occurs when two genes contribute to a processed transcript via a
  trans-splicing reaction:
  </p>

<div class="code">
spliced
leader
=======&gt;-----&gt;XXXXXXX*------&gt;
</div>

  <p>
  The simplest way to represent this is to show the mRNA as being split
  across two discontinuous genomic locations:
  <p>

<div class="code">
chrX  . gene               XXXX YYYY  .  +  . ID=gene01;name=my_gene
chrX  . mRNA               XXXX YYYY  .  +  . ID=tran01;Parent=gene01
chrX  . mRNA               XXXX YYYY  .  +  . ID=tran01;Parent=gene01
chrX  . exon               XXXX YYYY  .  +  . Parent=tran01
chrX  . CDS                XXXX YYYY  .  +  . ID=cds01;Parent=tran01
</div>

  <p>
  However, this does not indicate which part of the transcript comes
  from the spliced leader.  A preferred representation explicitly adds
  features for the spliced leader gene, the primary_transcript and the
  spliced_leader_RNA:
  </p>

<div class="code">
chrX  . gene               XXXX YYYY  .  +  . ID=gene01;name=my_gene
chrX  . gene               XXXX YYYY  .  +  . ID=gene02;name=leader_gene
chrX  . mRNA               XXXX YYYY  .  +  . ID=tran01;Parent=gene01,gene02
chrX  . mRNA               XXXX YYYY  .  +  . ID=tran01;Parent=gene01,gene02
chrX  . primary_transcript XXXX YYYY  .  +  . ID=pt01;Parent=tran01;Derives_from=gene01
chrX  . spliced_leader_RNA XXXX YYYY  .  +  . ID=sl01;Parent=tran01;Derives_from=gene02
chrX  . exon               XXXX YYYY  .  +  . Parent=tran01
chrX  . CDS                XXXX YYYY  .  +  . ID=cds01;Parent=tran01
</div>

  <p>
  As shown here, the mRNA derives from two genes ("my_gene" and the
  leader gene) and occupies disjunct coordinates on the genome.  The
  primary_transcript, which encodes the body of the mRNA, is part of
  (has as its Parent) this mRNA.  The same relationship applies to the
  spliced leader RNA.  The Derives_from relationship is used to indicate
  which genes produced the primary transcript and spliced leader
  respectively.
  </p>

  <p>
  The exon and CDS features follow in the normal fashion.
  </p>

  <dt>Programmed frameshift</dt>
  <dd>
  <p>
  This event occurs when the ribosome performs a programmed frameshift
  during translation in order to skip over an in-frame stop codon. The
  frameshift may occur forward or backward.
  </p>

<div class="code">
-------------------------&gt; mRNA
 ==========
	   ============*  CDS
</div>

  <p>
  The representation of this is to make the CDS discontinuous:
  </p>

<div class="code">
chrX  . gene               XXXX   YYYY  .  +  . ID=gene01;name=my_gene
chrX  . mRNA               XXXX   YYYY  .  +  . ID=tran01;Parent=gene01;Ontology_term=SO:1000069
chrX  . exon               XXXX   YYYY  .  +  . Parent=tran01
chrX  . CDS                XXXX   YYYY  0  +  . ID=cds01;Parent=tran01
chrX  . CDS                YYYY-1 ZZZZ  1  +  . ID=cds01;Parent=tran01
</div>

  <p>
  You will also need to adjust the phase field properly so that the CDS
  translates.
  </p>

  <p>
  It is suggested that the mRNA be tagged with the appropriate SO
  transcript attributes such as "minus_1_translational_frameshift"
  (SO:1000069).  This will allow all such programmed frameshift mRNAs to
  be recovered with a query. The accession for
  "plus_1_translational_frameshift" is SO:1001263.
  </p>

  <dt>An operon</dt>
  <dd>
  <p>
  A classic operon occurs when the genes in a polycistronic transcript
  are co-regulated by cis-regulatory element(s):
  </p>

<div class="code">
regulatory element
*  ================================================&gt; operon
   -----&gt;XXXXXXX*--&gt;BBBBBB*---&gt;ZZZZ*--&gt;AAAAAA*-----
</div>

<p>
It can be indicated in GFF3 in this way:
</p>

<div class="code">
chrX  . operon   XXXX YYYY  .  +  . ID=operon01;name=my_operon
chrX  . promoter XXXX YYYY  .  +  . Parent=operon01
chrX  . gene     XXXX YYYY  .  +  . ID=gene01;Parent=operon01;name=resA
chrX  . gene     XXXX YYYY  .  +  . ID=gene02;Parent=operon01;name=resB
chrX  . gene     XXXX YYYY  .  +  . ID=gene03;Parent=operon01;name=resX
chrX  . gene     XXXX YYYY  .  +  . ID=gene04;Parent=operon01;name=resZ
chrX  . mRNA     XXXX YYYY  .  +  . ID=tran01;Parent=gene01,gene02,gene03,gene04
chrX  . exon     XXXX YYYY  .  +  . ID=exon00001;Parent=tran01
chrX  . CDS      XXXX YYYY  .  +  . Parent=tran01;Derives_from=gene01
chrX  . CDS      XXXX YYYY  .  +  . Parent=tran01;Derives_from=gene02
chrX  . CDS      XXXX YYYY  .  +  . Parent=tran01;Derives_from=gene03
chrX  . CDS      XXXX YYYY  .  +  . Parent=tran01;Derives_from=gene04
</div>

<p>
The regulatory element ("promoter" in this example) is part of the
operon via the Parent tag.  The four genes are part of the operon, and
the resulting mRNA is multiply-parented by the four genes, as in the
earlier example.
</p>

<p>
At the time of this writing, promoters and other cis-regulatory
elements cannot be part_of an operon, but this restriction is being
reconsidered.
