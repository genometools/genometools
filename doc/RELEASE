Steps for preparing a new GenomeTools release
---------------------------------------------

1. make sure the generated documentation is up-to-date:

     $  make docs

2. build the release binaries

     $ make 64bit=yes amalgamation=yes cairo=no ... (depending on platform)

   Windows Cygwin builds may need 'errorcheck=no' because of some errors related
   to -fPIC.

3. update website

     $ make installwww

    A user account on the genometools.org server (anaheim) is required, as well
    as permissions to write to the web server directory. Adjust the Makefile
    settings SERVER (for user account to use in the 'installwww' target)
    and WWWBASEDIR if required. This step needs rsync to work.

4. tag release

     $ make release

   Creates a new version tag and pushes them to the git repositories.
   Also builds source distribution and pushes it to the genometools.org server.
   Adjust the Makefile settings SERVER and WWWBASEDIR if required.

5. bump version

   Increase version number in VERSION file. Also, create a new CHANGELOG
   entry with the new version number and commit the change with the
   message 'version bump'.

6. write email to gt-users mailing list (gt-users@genometools.org)

   There is a template in the doc/ subdirectory.
